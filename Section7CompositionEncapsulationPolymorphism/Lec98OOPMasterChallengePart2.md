# Lec 98 OOP Master Challenge Part 2

Continuing with the subclasses of Lec 97
* Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses) to cater for 
* a) Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items that can be added. 
  * The healthy burger can have 6 items' (Additions) in total. 
  * hint: youl probably want to process the two additional items in this new class (subclass of Hamburger), not the base class (Hamburger), since the additions are only appropriate for this new class (in other words new burger type). 
* b) Deluxe hamburger â€” comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed. 
  * hint: You have to find a way to automatically add these new additions at the time the deluxe burger object is created, and then prevent other additions being made. 
* All 3 classes should have a method that can be catted anytime to shov the base price of the hamburger 
* plus alt each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/finat total for the burger (base price + at t additions) 
* For the two additional classes this nay require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then adding totals to final price.
