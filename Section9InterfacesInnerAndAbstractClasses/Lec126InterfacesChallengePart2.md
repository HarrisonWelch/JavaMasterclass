# Lec 126 Interfaces Challenge Part 2

## Notes
* Ususally if you are using more generic behavior, you create an object of the interface type. `ISaveable player = new Player();`
  * The opposite is also true. Using more specific behavior of a class should lend declaration towards the class itself `Player player = new Player();`
